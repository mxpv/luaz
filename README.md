# luaz

luaz is a zero-cost wrapper library for Luau. Unlike other libraries, it focuses specifically on Luau, providing
idiomatic Zig bindings that leverage Luau's unique features and performance characteristics.

The build system provides the `luau-compiler` out of the box, making it easy to compile and embed Luau scripts
directly into your Zig applications.

## âœ¨ Features

- Minimal yet flexible zero-cost API.
- Zig functions automatically callable from Lua.
- Native `Vector` type support.
- Supports Luau code generation for improved performance on supported platforms.
- Built-in Luau compiler (`luau-compile` tool) provided by the build system.
- Excellent test coverage and API documentation.
