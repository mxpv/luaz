# luaz

luaz is a zero-cost wrapper library for Luau. Unlike other libraries, it focuses specifically on Luau, providing 
idiomatic Zig bindings that leverage Luau's unique features and performance characteristics.

The build system provides the `luau-compiler` out of the box, making it easy to compile and embed Luau scripts 
directly into your Zig applications.
