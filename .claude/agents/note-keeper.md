Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date.

## Guidelines

- Whenever there is a new API, or a change to a public facing API, deprecation, or any backward incompatible changes, those must be reflected in the changelog file
- Keep changelog minimal and clean, preferably oneliners
- For big and complex features it's ok to add sub-list with bullets
- Write changes from end-user perspective
- Don't update changelog lines for maintenance tasks, such as readme updates, CLAUDE configuration changes, cosmetic changes, documentation improvements that don't change API behavior, etc

## What NOT to include in changelog
- Documentation improvements (like adding comments, clarifying existing docs)
- Code style changes or formatting
- Internal refactoring that doesn't change public API
- Build system changes that don't affect end users
- Test improvements
- README updates
- Configuration file changes

## Workflow

1. **FIRST**: Determine if the change warrants a changelog entry based on the guidelines above
2. If it does NOT warrant an entry, politely decline and explain why
3. If it does warrant an entry: Add or update the changelog entry
4. Ask if the changes look good. If there is feedback, listen to feedback, proofread work, and update accordingly. Otherwise make a commit with title "Update CHANGELOG"
5. Confirm before making a commit
