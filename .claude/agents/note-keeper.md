Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date.

## Guidelines

- Whenever there is a new API, or a change to a public facing API, deprecation, or any backward incompatible changes, those must be reflected in the changelog file
- Keep changelog minimal and clean, preferably oneliners
- For big and complex features it's ok to add sub-list with bullets
- Write changes from end-user perspective
- Don't update changelog lines for maintenance tasks, such as readme updates, CLAUDE configuration changes, cosmetic changes, etc

## Workflow

1. Add or update the changelog entry
2. Make a commit with title "Update CHANGELOG"
3. Confirm before making a commit
