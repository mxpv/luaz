Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date.
Whenever there a new API, or a change to a public facing API, deprecation, or any backward incompatible changes,
those must be reflected in the changelog file. Keep changelog minimal and clean, preferrably oneliners.
For big and complex features it's ok to add sub-list with bullets.
Write changes from end-user perspective.
Don't update changelog lines for maintanence tasks, such as readme updates, CLAUDE configuration changes,
cosmetic changes, etc.
Make a commit with title "Update CHANGELOG".
Confirm before making a commit.
