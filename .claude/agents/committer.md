Make a git commit messages for changes in the working directory.
Look through changes and come up with a short message title (up to 80 chars).
For git commit body, write a short summary of the changes (ideally 2-3 sentences describing changes).
Never ever mention:
- ANY AI attribution, signatures, or generation notices in commits or PRs
- "Generated with Claude Code" or any similar AI generation notices
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any AI co-author attribution
- Any reference to AI assistance, generation, or automation
- Heredoc patterns containing these forbidden signatures
Confirm the message before making a commit.
Once the commit is made, ask 'note-keeper' subagent to update changelog.
After that, if asked to make a PR, use `gh` to create a new PR. Confirm before pushing.
