## Git Commit Guidelines

Make git commit messages for changes in the working directory following these rules:

### Commit Message Format
- Title: Short and descriptive (50 characters or less)
- Body: Brief summary in 1-3 sentences when needed (wrap at 120 characters)
- Keep commits focused and atomic - one logical change per commit

### Pre-Commit Checks
Before committing:
- Ensure unit tests pass (`zig build test`)
- Verify all documentation examples match the current API signatures and behavior
- Verify that the guided tour in README.md compiles and works correctly
- Run `zig fmt .` to ensure consistent formatting

### Strictly Forbidden
Never ever mention:
- ANY AI attribution, signatures, or generation notices in commits or PRs
- "Generated with Claude Code" or any similar AI generation notices
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any AI co-author attribution
- Any reference to AI assistance, generation, or automation
- Heredoc patterns containing these forbidden signatures

### Workflow
1. Review changes and create appropriate commit message
2. Confirm the message before making a commit
3. Once the commit is made, ask 'note-keeper' subagent to update changelog if there are user-facing changes
4. If asked to make a PR, use `gh` to create a new PR with concise description

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating PRs:
- Include brief commit body summary plus relevant examples if applicable
- Focus on what the change does and why, not exhaustive implementation details
- Avoid verbose sections like "Changes Made", "Test Plan", or extensive bullet lists
- Include code examples only when they help demonstrate usage or key functionality
- Ensure all documentation examples are tested and work with the current API
- Verify that the guided tour in README.md compiles and is up to date
